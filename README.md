# Blockchain-Based Medical Record Storer

## Overview

This project is a decentralized application (dApp) designed to securely store and manage medical records using blockchain technology. The application leverages the power of Ethereum smart contracts to ensure data integrity and security, and utilizes modern web technologies for an intuitive user interface.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used to create the front-end of the application.
- **Move**: A programming language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, used to implement the medical record contracts.
- **Redux Toolkit**: A library for managing and centralizing application state, used to handle state management in the React application.
- **Petra**: A cryptocurrency wallet and gateway to blockchain apps, used to interact with the Ethereum network.

## Features

- **Secure Medical Record Storage**: Medical records are stored on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring they are immutable and tamper-proof.
- **User Authentication**: Users can authenticate and interact with the dApp using MetaMask.
- **Decentralized Access**: Records can be accessed and managed in a decentralized manner, without relying on a central authority.
- **Intuitive UI**: A responsive and user-friendly interface built with React.js.
- **State Management**: Efficient state management using Redux Toolkit to handle user sessions and application state.
